The solution to this excercise would be to extend the domain.yml file with folowing declarations:

- intent:
  - change_status
  
- entity:
  - status
  
- slot:
  - status:
    - type: text
    (probably influencing the conversation)
    
In nlu.yml file a new training patterns should be added, those could be:

- intent: change_status
  examples: |
    - the candidate [failed](status) the interview
    - the candidate [passed](status) the interview
    - the candidate was [accepted](status)
    - the candidate was [declined](status)
    - the interview went [badly](status)
    - the interview went [great](status)
    
which then can be used for training the model

Additionaly a synonyms can be created to keep the model consistent

- synonym: failed
  examples: |
  - declined
  - failed
  - bad
  - badly

- synonym: passed
  examples: |
  - passed
  - accepted
  - great
  
Or maybe not
